# SentiGAN-Stock-Prediction

A novel stock market prediction model using GANs enhanced with sentiment analysis. This project combines historical stock data and social media sentiment through Variational Autoencoder (VAE) feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) generators, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) discriminators to improve accuracy.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following main folders:

### 1. **Code Folder**
Contains Python scripts for various stock price prediction models with and without sentiment analysis. Below is a brief description of each file:

- **`0_Twitter_Scrapper.py`**: Scrapes tweets using the Twitter API from 2021-10-20 to 2022-09-29.
- **`1_sentimentanalysis&_data_preprocessing.py`**: Performs sentiment analysis on social media data and preprocesses textual and historical stock data for model training.
- **`2a_sentiment_lstm_stock_price_prediction.py`**: Implements an LSTM-based stock price prediction model incorporating sentiment analysis.
- **`2b_lstm_stock_price_prediction.py`**: Implements an LSTM-based stock price prediction model without sentiment analysis.
- **`3a_sentiment_gru_stock_price_prediction.py`**: Implements a GRU-based stock price prediction model incorporating sentiment analysis.
- **`3b_gru_stock_price_prediction.py`**: Implements a GRU-based stock price prediction model without sentiment analysis.
- **`4a_sentiment_gan_stock_price_prediction.py`**: Implements a GAN-based stock price prediction model incorporating sentiment analysis. Contains generator and discriminator definitions.
- **`4b_gan_stock_price_prediction.py`**: Implements a GAN-based stock price prediction model without sentiment analysis.

> **Note:** Only `.py` files for non-sentiment versions of the three tested models (LSTM, GRU, GAN) are included instead of `.ipynb` due to space limitations.

### 2. **Final_Model Folder**
Contains the best-performing GAN model for both the generator and discriminator. This model, generated by `4a_sentiment_gan_stock_price_prediction.py`, demonstrated superior performance with the least error in stock price prediction.

---

### 3. **Processed_Data Folder**
Includes the following processed data files:

- **`amzn_daily_sentiment_scores.csv`**: Daily sentiment scores for Amazon (AMZN) stock derived from social media analysis.
- **`processed_amzn_data.csv`**: Processed Amazon stock data, including price information, technical indicators, and daily sentiment scores (2021-10-20 to 2022-09-29).

---

### 4. **Raw_Data Folder**
Contains the raw data files used in this project:

- **`stock_yfinance_data.csv`**: A dataset of tweets for the top 25 most-watched stock tickers on Yahoo Finance, including price and volume data for corresponding dates and stocks (30-09-2021 to 30-09-2022).
- **`amzn_tweets.csv`**: Tweets mentioning the AMZN ticker, discussing Amazon stock on Twitter (30-09-2021 to 30-09-2022).

## Key Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: Combines social media sentiment with historical stock data to enhance predictive accuracy.
2. **VAE for Feature Extraction**: Utilizes a Variational Autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.
3. **Deep Learning Models**:
   - LSTM and GRU-based models for sequential stock price prediction.
   - GANs for generating synthetic stock price data and improving prediction performance.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: All models are tested with and without sentiment integration, demonstrating the importance of sentiment data in stock prediction.

## Results Summary

- **Best Model**: Sentiment-enhanced GAN achieved:
  - **RMSE**: 4.5250
  - **R-squared**: 0.5138
- Comparison of other models (with and without sentiment integration):
  - LSTM, GRU, and GAN-based approaches highlight the superior performance of sentiment-enhanced models.
